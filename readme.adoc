= CS106L

* Assignment 1: WikiRacer Pt. 1
* Assignment 2: WikiRacer Pt. 2

These two assignments are very simple, just need to call some functions that STL has implemented.
But due to the Chinese government's great internet blocking policy, I spent a lot of time (more than 3 hours) setting up the environment for the sake of getting my program to connect to Wikipedia.

* Assignment 3: STL HashMap

This assignment is pretty nice, I think I can't implement a STL HashMap without the guidance from CS106L.
